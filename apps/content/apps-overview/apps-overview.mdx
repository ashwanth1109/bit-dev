# Apps overview

An _app_ is a Component that is deployable, and therefore available in runtime. That includes full applications, as well as, micro-frontends, microservices and serverless functions.

Since Components are always independent, a deployable Component (a.k.a, an app) contains all the information it needs for it to be built and deployed.
