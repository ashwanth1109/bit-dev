import { Image } from './image';

A standard React background image component. Promotes alternative text, native lazy loading, long description and textual fallbacks for images as well as supporting the rendering of the image as a background image.

### An image with alt tag

Alt text should give the intent, purpose, and meaning of the image. Blind users should get as much information from alt text as a sighted user gets from the image.

```js live

### A decorative image with empty alt tag

Decorative images are used for layout or non-informative purposes, and do not appear within a link. They should contain an empty alt attribute.

### A lazy loaded image

- lazy: Defer loading of the resource until it reaches a calculated distance from the viewport.
- eager: Load the resource immediately, regardless of where it's located on the page.

```js live
<Image
  src="https://static.bit.dev/bit-logo.svg"
  alt="bit logo"
  loading="lazy"
/>
```

### A background image

When using as a backgound image, `height` should be supplied via css or inline styles in order to display. `background-size` should also be supplied in order for background to render correctly
