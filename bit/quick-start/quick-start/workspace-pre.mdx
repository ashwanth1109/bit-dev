## Create workspace

The first step in the Bit journey is to initiate a [Bit workspace](/workspaces). You can use the Bit workspace to either create, use or import components,
make changes to them, and export these changes back. Workspaces are tech-agnonstic and allow development of components of all kinds. They can be used by a single developer
maintaining few components for a certain scope of work and exist on top of existing repositories or shared as a [Workspace component](/workspace/workspace-component).

It is recommended to [create a bit.cloud account](https://bit.cloud/signup) prior to creating the workspace to ensure the right owner name for your components.
You can choose to host the Bit yourself, choose a name for the remote scope in which the component you be hosted.
