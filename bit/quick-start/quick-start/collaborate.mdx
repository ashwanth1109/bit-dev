## Collaborate

Now that we have done our work and all seems to be working locally, its time to share our changes and collaborate with others.  
Bit tells you exacly which components has changed.

```
$ bit status
```

### Create a remote scope

Earlier we have chosen a default Scope for our workspace. We need to either host our own scope, or use Bit Cloud.

If you don't have a remote scope yet, it is a good time to create one! You can create and host scopes on [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) for free
or [self-host your scope](/docs/scope/running-a-scope-server).

### Snap your changes
To record your component changes you can use:
```
bit snap --all --message 'initial snap'
```

To release components in a new semantic version, use:

```
bit tag --all --message 'initial tag'
```

### Create a Lane (Alpha)
To record changes on a Lane. 

```bash
bit lane create my-feature
```

Then, use `snap` to record your changes into the Lane:

```bash 
bit snap --all --message 'my first lane snap'
```


### Export changes to remote scopes

After recoding component changes with snaps or tags, you can sync the staging changes with the defined remote scopes.

```
bit export
```

### Be aware to how changes affect others

Bit automaticlly detects affected dependents in your Workspace. It is a best practice import few or more dependents and test
your changes against them prior to releasing.

```
bit import blocks/header --dependents
```

Running `test` and `build` can test your modified components vs affected dependenies. 
```
bit test
```

## Think your "Quick Start" is better than ours?

If you think your quick start is better than ours, or just shows the same on a different tech stack or product. Create a component
using our [Quick Start component](https://bit.cloud/teambit/bit/quick-start) and share a link with [community@bit.dev](mailto:community@bit.dev)
or our [community Slack](https://bit-dev-community.slack.com/ssb/redirect)!

- Dive deeper into any of the topics.
