## Installation

To get started, we would first have to make sure the `bit` binary is installed on your machine and configured to your `PATH`.

```bash
npx @teambit/bvm install
```

For a more advanced installation guide, [head to our installation section](/docs/getting-started/installing-bit/installing-bit).

### Creating the workspace

The first step in the Bit journey is to create a [component development workspace](/workspaces). You can use the Bit workspace to either create, use or import components,
make changes to them, and export these changes back. Workspaces are tech-agnonstic and allow development of components of all kinds. They can be used by a single developer
maintaining few components for a certain scope of work and exist on top of existing repositories or shared as a [Workspace component](/workspace/workspace-component).

:::tip
It is recommended to [create a bit.cloud account](https://bit.cloud/signup) prior to creating the workspace to ensure the right owner name for your components.
You can choose to host the Bit yourself, choose a name for the remote scope in which the component you be hosted.

To create a new workspace, run:

```bash
bit new my-wiki --default-scope my-org.wiki
```

```bash
cd my-wiki
```

Start the Workspace UI console:

```bash
bit start
```

:::tip
It is recommended to open an editor like VSCode on the workspace to start editing the components source code. To learn more on [editor setup head here](/editor-setup).

Bit was designed for gradual adoption and has a minimal footprint. Since components are isolated, Bit can easily co-exist next to other development tools,
across different projects. This tutorial demonstrates creating a new workspace, to [start from an existing project head here](/getting-started/installing-bit/add-to-existing-project).
