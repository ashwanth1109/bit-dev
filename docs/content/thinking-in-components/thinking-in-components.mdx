# Thinking in components

<Subtitle style={{ fontSize: 20 }}>
  Component-driven software might make you think differently about software design and architecture. Bit puts a phyisical barriar between components, helping you think
  of every component as independent, driving better software design.

- Physical barrier 
- Component driven software
- Component based frameworks
- Unlocking component-driven benefits.

Component-driven software is about defining and implementing independent components and composing them into features and apps. It changes the way you think about software
design and architecture, encouraging to think in independent components rather then in components as implmentation details. 
Bit changes the way you think about software design and architecture and helps you build better component driven software. It makes you think in components rather in applications, with components as their implementation details.
Thinking in components 


Bit can change how you think about software design and the apps you build. We are used to think applications, having components as implmentation details. 
. Bit makes it easier to implment independent components and compose them into systems.  

## Component-based frameworks
Component based frameworks are transforming how we think about software architecture and development. React, Angular, Vue and Web components has transformed how we think
about composing UI interfaces and applications in general. Harmony which Bit is based on, is also a component-driven framework intended for feature development.

## Start with a product specification
Imagine that you already a RESTful API and a design from a designer. React has put up a great doc



## Step 1: Break the software into component hierarchy

## Step 2: API design

## Step 3: Build independent components
