# Installing Bit

To use Bit you will need to install it on your system. Do this by first installing BVM, a version manager for Bit and then installing Bit.

The quickest way to install BVM is using `npx`.

```bash
npx @teambit/bvm install
```

:::note

If you get a warning or the `bvm` command is not available you will need to run the code below.

## Upgrading Bit

To upgrade to the latest version of Bit:

```bash
npx @teambit/bvm upgrade
```

## Troubleshoot instllation issues

For any installation issues, advanced questions and additional information visit the [BVM documentation](/docs/reference/using-bvm).

### I'm getting "command is not available" error

If you get a warning or the `bvm` command is not available you will need to run the code below.

- **Windows**
```bash
setx path "%path%;%LocalAppData%\.bvm"
```
- **MacOS/Linux** (Bash)
```bash
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```
- **MacOS/Linux** (ZSH)
```bash
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

### Prerequisites

You may encounter issues running Bit commands if either of these tools are not installed on your system.

- **NodeJS** - Bit requires NodeJS 14, 15 or 16 to be installed on your system.  
- **Git** - Bit uses Git for solving merge conflicts and other capabilities.

### I have legacy version pre-installed

If you have the legacy version of Bit installed on your system, Bit links the binary name for the new version as `bbit`.

## Start a Bit powered workspace

You can start a new component-driven project with Bit. To do that, either head to [Quick start](/quick-start) or to [Start a new Bit workspace](/getting-started/installing-bit/start-bit-workspace) for more in-depth.

## Share components from existing projects

If you are looking for liberating existing components from projects, head over to [Add to existing project](/getting-started/installing-bit/add-to-existing-project).
