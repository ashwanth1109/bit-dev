# Create a new Workspace

A Bit [Workspace](/workspace/overview) is where components are built and composed. Workspaces can be generated with the `bit new` command or [initialized on an existing project](/getting-started/start-from-existing-project/init-workspace-on-existing-project/general-purpose).

The easiest way to initiate a new Workspace is from a template. To see a list of available workspaces templates, run:

```bash
bit templates
```

:::note
Running the `bit templates` command **_inside_** a Workspace will output a list of **_component templates _**.
:::
Templates are used to ramp up a new project with skeleton components. You can use one of these common templates or find additional templates on the [bit.dev community](https://bit.dev/templates).

:::info
It will be easier to follow along if you create a remote [Scope](/scope/overview) at this moment. You can quickly [create a free Scope on the Bit Cloud](https://bit.dev/create-scope) or [host your own Scope](/scope/hosting-remote-scope). Use the `--scope` flag for all generated components to include your Remote Scope.
:::

Creating the Workspace should be done by configuring a [Scope name](/scope/overview#scope-name). For this example, we would use the `bitorg.experience` scope name, which combines the organization name `bitorg` and the `experience` team owning it.

To learn in-depth on [Creating a Workspace head here](/workspace/creating-workspaces).

Let's create our Workspace from the React template:

```bash
bit new react my-workspace
cd my-workspace
```

Congrats! You have created your first [Workspace](/workspace/overview). `bit new` has initialized the [minimal footprint](/workspace/initializing-workspaces#created-files) required for a [Workspace](/workspace/overview), and generated the workspace according to the [Workspace Files](/workspace/creating-workspaces#created-files), [components](/workspace/workspace-component) and [configuration](/workspace/workspace-json) defined in the chosen [Workspace Template](/workspace/workspace-templates).

The following directory tree demonstrates the generated directories and files created by the [Workspace Generator](/workspace/overview):

```bash
├── .git/bit --> Local Scope associated with the Workspace.
├── .bitmap
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── pnpm-lock.yaml --> chosen package manager lock file
├── node_modules --> includes external workspace modules and Workspace Component Links.
├── public
    └── ... --> The Workspace public assets, generated upon new Aspect configuration or the first time.
├── demo --> Demo components generated by the chosen template
│   ├── pages
│   │   └── welcome
│   │       ├── index.ts
│   │       ├── welcome.spec.tsx
│   │       ├── welcome.composition.tsx
│   │       ├── welcome.docs.mdx
│   │       ├── welcome.module.scss
│   │       └── welcome.tsx
│   └── ... -> more components defined in chosen the Workspace Template.
├── types --> `types` directory generated as Workspace files generated by the template.
│   ├── asset.d.ts
│   └── style.d.ts
├── tsconfig.json --> Workspace file defined in the template.
├── .eslintrc.js --> Workspace file defined in the template.
└── workspace.jsonc --> main configuration file for the Workspace
```

As seen above, the following assets were created:

- [.bitmap file](/workspace/bitmap). `.bitmap` maps Components to corresponding [Component Directory](/workspace/component-directory) in the file system.
- [workspace.jsonc](/workspace/workspace-json) file. Main configuration file for the Bit Workspace.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`. <!-- TODO [Lock file](/dependencies/lock-file) --> Lock file generated by [pnpm](/understanding-bit/package-managers#pnpm), the default package manager.
- [node_modules](/workspace/node-modules) directory. Including [External Dependencies](/dependencies/external-dependencies) and [Workspace Components Links](/workspace/component-link).
- [Template Components](/generator/components-template) as defined in the [Workspace Template](/generator/workspace-template).
- [Workspace files](/workspace/creating-workspaces#created-files). Files generated defined in the Workspace Template including `tsconfig.json`, `.eslintrc.js` and `types` directory.
- .git/bit <!-- TODO [.git/bit](/scopes/local-scope) -->. [Local Scope](/scope/overview#local-scope) associated with the Workspace.
- Newly initiated Git repository <!--TODO [Git repository](/) -->. Can be skipped with the `--skip-git` flag.

Checking the [Workspace Status](/workspace/workspace-status) using the `bit status` command will reveal that all components are under `new` status. `new` status means these components created were never versioned before:

```bash
bit status
```

```bash
new components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > templates/envs/my-react ... ok
     > templates/pages/welcome ... ok
     > templates/ui/card ... ok
     > templates/ui/heading ... ok
     > templates/ui/text ... ok
```

`ok` means a component has no known issues. We encourage you to study further about [Workspace Status](/workspace/workspace-status) and its different states.

[Workspaces come with a UI interface](/workspace/workspace-ui) to enable a consistent UI for Components built anywhere. It helps during development and eases everyday development tasks such as component documentation, discovery, testing, visualization, and exploring history logs and architectural dependency graphs. It is customizable to work with every tool. You can initiate the Workspace UI with the `bit start` command:

```bash
bit start
```

`bit start` will initiate the Bit Workspace UI and its required dev servers <!-- TODO [required dev servers](/bundlers/dev-server) --> while opening the UI in your default browser.

<Image atl="workspace ui" src={workspaceUi} />

Have a look at the component sidebar above; please note that every Component has its status marked (`N` represents `new`), which corresponds to the [Workspace Status](/workspace/workspace-status) shown above.

Use `Ctrl-K` to open the Workspace UI quick search and toggle between components fast!

### Workspace directory structure

By default, [directory structure in the Workspace](/workspace/directory-structure) is structured in [Scopes](/scope/overview), which help define team boundaries and ownership as well as [Namespaces](/components/namespaces) which are helpful for organizing and configuring Components. Every Component has its own [Component Directory](/workspace/component-directory). Workspaces can be scaled over time, include new components, or distributed to more Workspaces for more teams to take ownership over specific features.
To learn more on [Repository Architecture head over here](/understanding-bit/repository-architecture/overview).

```bash
templates --> `Scope` used to define team boundaries and ownership
├── ...
├── pages --> `Component Namespaces` to assist with organization and configuration of components used
│   └── welcome --> `Component Directory` includes a specific Component implantation.
│       ├── index.ts
│       ├── welcome.spec.tsx
│       ├── welcome.composition.tsx
│       ├── welcome.docs.mdx
│       ├── welcome.module.scss
│       └── welcome.tsx
└── ui
    ├── card
    │   ├── card.composition.tsx
    │   ├── card.docs.mdx
    │   ├── card.module.scss
    │   ├── card.spec.tsx
    │   ├── card.tsx
    │   └── index.ts
    └── ...
```

:::note
Directory structures in the Bit Workspace are fully flexible and can be structured in any way as long as each Component resides in an individual directory. To learn more on structuring Workspaces, head over to the [Workspace Structure](/workspace/workspace-structure) section.

### Configuring Workspaces' name and icon

Workspace specific configurations such as `name` and `icon` can be configured in [workspace.json](/workspace/workspace-json) through the `teambit.workspace/workspace` Aspect configuration.

```json
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "My first Bit Workspace",
    "icon": "https://static.bit.dev/bit-logo.svg",
  }
```

### External dependencies

`bit install` keeps your [Workspace](/workspace/overview) up to date with external dependencies, Component Objects <!--TODO [Component Objects](/) --> and [Workspace Component Links](/workspace/component-link), usually after a `git pull`. Allowed workspace dependencies are configured in the [Dependency Policy](/dependencies/overview#dependency-policies) in the [Workspace Configuration](/workspace/workspace-json).

```bash
bit install
```

It can also be used for adding new [External Dependencies](/dependencies/external-dependencies):

```bash
bit install @teambit/base-ui.button
```

### Configure Aspects (Bit Extensions) on the Workspace

<!--TODO explanation required
 -->

```json
{
  "owner.scope/some-extension": {}
}
```

### Debugging in the Workspace

[Base Templates](/generator/workspace-template) comes built-in with an example launch.json for [VSCode Debugging Configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging). To learn more on IDE debugger configuration, head here.<!--TODO [LINK](/) -->

<!--TODO Webstorm to be added here.
