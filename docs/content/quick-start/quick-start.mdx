# Quick Start

Welcome to Bits' Documentation!

Bit is a framework for building and collaborating on components. It helps teams build components together and compose them into various features and apps. This kind of workflow allows assembling anything in a component-driven architecture ([CDD](https://blog.bitsrc.io/component-driven-development-with-bit-dd7bc91ae387)): from UI applications, backend services
and even CLI tools.

## Installing Bit

```bash
npx @teambit/bvm install
```

The command above will install Bit Version Manager and the latest version of Bit.

Learn more about upgrading and installing Bit on the [BVM (Bit Version Manager) documantation](/bvm/installing-bit).

### Creating a Workspace

A [Workspace](/workspace/overview) is where you build and compose components. Creating a new [Workspace](/workspace/overview) is performed with the `bit new` command followed by the [Workspace Template](/workspace/workspace-templates) of your choice and the directory name for the Workspace.

For instance, to create a Workspace with the React template on a directory named my-workspace, run the following command:

```bash
bit new react my-workspace
```

After the command above finishes running, we can enter the Workspace folder and run the Bit dev server. You'll be able to see some demo components that come with the template:

```bash
cd my-workspace
bit start
```

Learn more about [Workspaces](/workspace/overview).

### Create Components

A quick way to [create a new component](/getting-started/compose-components/create-components) is to use our pre-defined templates.

For example, to create a new React component, run:

```bash
bit create react ui/my-component
```

This command will add a new React component to your workspace under the `ui` [namespace](/components/component-id#sub-categories-with-namespaces).

You'll find in this folder five files:

- **index.ts**: For exporting the component. This file is a must-have.
- **my-component.tsx**: The implementation of the component.
- **my-component.composition.tsx**: In this file, we create various compositions for our component.
- **my-component.spec.tsx**: This is the place where we import our compositions and test them.
- **my-component.docs.mdx**: A good component is a well-documented one.

:::tip
Use the `bit templates` command to see a list of available component templates.

### Use Dependencies

<!-- TODO -->

### Dev environments

Bit helps to simplify and standardize common operations required for developing components like [compiling](/compiler/overview), [testing](/tester/overview), [linting](/linter/overview), [formatting](/formatter/overview) and more.
Go to [Env Services](/envs/core-services) to learn more about Bits' different services.

Compile your components and store the output in the `node_modules` directory:

```bash
bit compile
```

Test your components:

```bash
bit test
```

Lint your components:

```bash
bit lint
```

Format your components:

```bash
bit format
```

You can use the `--help` flag for each of these commands to learn more.

:::note
Bit automatically watches and re-executes your components tests while running the dev-server using the `bit start` command.

Learn more about [component testing](/tester/overview).

## Collaborate on Components

Version your components and host them remotely to collaborate with others.

### Version Components

With `bit status`, you can see the components that were modified and need to be versioned as well as how dependents are affected
from these changes:

```bash
bit status
```

You can version multiple components and dependencies with ease. Version modified components and their dependents
with a single command:

```bash
bit tag --all 1.0.0 --message 'my first version'
```

### Share Components

To export your components, you need to create a remote scope. Creating a remote Scope can be done
by [hosting your own](/getting-started/release-components/create-remote-scope/self-host-scope) or creating a Scope on [Bits' cloud provider](https://bit.dev).

```bash
bit export
```

:::note
Before exporting make sure you have set the default scope to be your [remote scope](/scope/setting-remote-scope) in the `workspace.jsonc` file and run `bit link
:::

## Use Components

### Install Components

Bit helps you install and resolve packages in your Workspace with the `bit install` command. It makes sure that every component in your Workspace is resolved with the correct package dependencies and their corresponding versions.

```bash
bit install @teambit/base-ui.my-component
```

:::note
You can configure the package manager of your choice in the `workspace.jsonc` file. The supported package managers for `bit install` are currently [Yarn 2.0](/) and [pnpm](/).
:::

Components can be installed with any package manager in any other app, be it a Bit Workspace or not.

```bash
npm install @teambit/base-ui.my-component
```

Make sure you [configure the Bit registry](/configurations/config-files#npm-config-npmrc) if you use Bits' cloud provider. Components can be published to any registry or integrated with Artifactory or Nexus.

### Importing Components

Components can be [imported (cloned)](/workspace/importing-components) to any Bit Workspace. By importing components, you can change the components' source code from any Bit Workspace and then export a new version and eject it from your Workspace.

```bash
bit import some-org.scope/my-component
```
