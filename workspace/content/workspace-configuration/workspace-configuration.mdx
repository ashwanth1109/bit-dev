# Configuring the Workspace (workspace.jsonc)

The `workspace.jsonc` serves as the main configuration file for the workspace and its components.

`workspace.jsonc` is composed of a list of [Aspects](/extending-bit/aspect-overview) and their corresponding configurations.
To add configuration to the `workspace.jsonc`, first add the relevant Aspect, and then set its configuration.

For example, to set the Workspace name, add the `teambit.workspace/workspace` Aspect and set its `"name"` property.
To set versions to install in that Workspace, add the `teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver` Aspect, and set its `"policy"` property

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "my-workspace",
  },
  "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "policy": {
      "dependencies": {
        "classnames": "2.3.1",
        "text-transform": "^0.1.2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- `teambit.workspace/workspace`: The Workspace Aspect (responsible for the Workspace)
- `teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver`: The Dependency Resolver Aspect (responsible for dependency management)

Since each Aspect is a [Component](/docs/components/components-overview), it uses the [Component ID](/docs/components/component-id) pattern.


The workspace configuration is extensible. It is not limited to a pre-configured list of Aspects.

## teambit.workspace/workspace

`teambit.workspace/workspace` receives configurations for the workspace itself, as well as default values for components managed by the workspace.

### name

```ts
name: string;
```

The name of the workspace. This name will be displayed in the workspace UI.

### icon

```ts
icon: string;
```

Th path to an icon (svg, jpeg, etc.). The icon wll be displayed in the workspace UI.

### defaultScope

```ts
defaultScope: string;
```

The default scope for all components in the workspace (this will be overridden by any other source of configuration, For example, variant)

### defaultDirectory

```ts
defaultDirectory: string;
```

The default directory (relative path) to place a component during `bit import` and `bit create`.

The following placeholders are available:

<!-- TODO: add links to component id page -->

- `name` - the component full name
- `scopeId` - the scope-id
- `scope` - scope name
- `owner` - owner name

For example:

```json
{
  "defaultDirectory": "{scope}/{name}"
}
```

## Adding an Aspect to the workspace configuration

When you add an Aspect to the workspace configuration you affect all components in that Workspace.

For example, the custom Aspect `my-org.my-scope/snapshot` defines files that match the glob pattern `**/snapshot.*` as [dev files](/docs/components/dev-files).
Adding that Aspect to the workspace configuration will define the `**/snapshot.*` files of every component in that Workspace as a dev files.

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    // ..
  },
  "company.scope/extensions/my-dev-files": {}
}
```

:::note 
Workspace configuration only affect components in that Workspace.
Once a component is exported and maintained in another Workspace, it will no longer be affected by that Aspect.
For information about how to apply an Aspect on a Component, see [Component configuration](/components/component-config).
