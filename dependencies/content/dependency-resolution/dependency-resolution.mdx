# Dependency Resolution

Bit greatly simplifies component dependency management by automating most of it. The Dependency Resolver detects component dependencies by parsing out their [files'] `import`/`require` statements. It then determines their dependency type ('runtime', 'peer', or 'dev'), their module type ('package' or 'component'), and resolves their version number.

Dependency versions are resolved during the component versioning (`bit tag` or `bit snap`).

Dependencies of module-type 'components', are always registered using the concrete version number of the dependency that was installed in their `node_modules` directory, during their build.
This is done to ensure a component functions the same when installed in other projects.

## Determining the dependency type



## The dependency policies hierarchy

The Dependency Resolver integrates dependency policies from various sources to determine the component's final dependency graph.

Cases of conflicting policies are resolved according to a hierarchy of source types, where the one at the top overrides the rest.

The hierarchy in a descending order:

1. Policies set by Variants (@teambit/variants) and the component.json files of "ejected" components (these two sources are merged by Variants).
2. Policies set by various aspects (using `registerDependencyPolicy`)
3. Policies set by the Env (using the `getDependencies` service handler)
4. Bitâ€™s automated dependency detections, and policies set by the Dependency Resolver at the workspace configuration root-level.

Use the `bit dependencies <component-id>` command to understand the calculations and interactions that resolved in the generated dependency graph of a specific component.
