# Aspects Overview

Bit is built entirely with Bit. This means that even Bit itself is built in a component-driven architecture. It uses [Harmony](https://bit.cloud/teambit/harmony/harmony) which is a component-based framework for 
composing extensible features into apps. Harmony most fundemental type is an Aspect, every Aspect is a full stack feature, capable of extending UI, backend and any other defined runtime
environment. Every Aspect also acts as a service to all others, and its API can be used from any other aspect.

We use Harmony as a way to scale development of dev experiences. We dogfood the API

## Configurable


## Aspect
Aspect is a way to define 

```ts
export class MyLoggerFeature {
  private logs = [];

  log(log: string) {
    this.logs.push(log);
    console.log('log something');
  }

  listLogs() {
    return this.logs;
  }

  static async provider() {
    return MyFeature();
  }
}
```

## Dependencies
Aspects can use other aspect APIs by defining them as dependnecies. Dependencies are injected to Aspects in inversion of control and maintained by Harmony in a container.

## Config
Aspect can declare and accept configuration. Configuration is done 

## Slots
